# Bergen Evans

This repo contains my code for both the homeworks and the labs that we have done and will do in APPM 4600

This repo will help me because if I ever have any questions about how to write a code for a specific function or if I am trying to remember how I did something in lab, it will all be right there for me to see and refer back to.

add, commit, and push will be very important to do often

This lab is meant to help gain an understanding of python in relation to the concepts we will learn in class

The subdirectories of the repo put the homework and the labs into their respective folders to keep them separated
